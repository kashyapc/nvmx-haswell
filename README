- Nested Virtualization is the ability to run guest hypervisors (L1) --
  running on a host hypervisor (L0) -- which can have their own
  associated nested guests (L2).

    - Nested virtualization setup: ./SETUP-nVMX.rst

    - Scripts to create L1, L2: ./tests/scripts/

    - Libvirt XMLs for L1, L2: ./tests/libvirt-xmls-for-l1-l2

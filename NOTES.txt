Use Cases
---------
Below are some use cases for nested virt (some of them are collated from
upstream KVM mailing discussions).

    * OpenStack nova guests can take advantage of good nested virt performance:

        - Also helpful for OpenStack in a single node (VM) set ups can be tested
          more meaningfully.

        - Where: L0 -- Physical host; L1 -- Guest hypervisor; L2 -- Nested guest

    * A "cloud user" gets a beefy guest hypervisor & can cheerfully run/manage
      multiple guests for developing or testing w/o the hassle and intervention of
      the cloud provider.

    * Enable live migration of entire hypervisors with their guests - for
      load balancing, disaster recovery, and so on.

    * Make it easier to test, demonstrate, benchmark and debug hypervisors,
      and also entire virtualization setups. An entire virtualization setup
      (hypervisor and all its guests) could be run as one virtual machine,
      allowing testing many such setups on one physical machine.

    * Hosting one of the new breed of operating systems which have a hypervisor
      as part of them. Windows 7 with XP mode is one example. Linux with KVM
      is another.

    * Platforms with embedded hypervisors in firmware need nested virt to
      run any workload - which can itself be a hypervisor with guests.

    * Honeypots and protection against hypervisor-level rootkits.

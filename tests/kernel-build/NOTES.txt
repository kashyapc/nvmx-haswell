    - TODO: Experiment (thanks Abel Gordon!) 
        (1) Do a "short make" (that does not take more than a few
            minutes, minimal config). 
        (2) Then, try a "long make" to monitor consistency.

    - Note that the source files will be loaded from disk only the first
      run (lot of I/O, which is slow with nested).  Next runs may load
      the files from the page-cache and you may notice a performance
      improvement.

    - "make clean" only removes files in file system, but does not clear
      memory (page-cache).
    
        - To clean it: Either reboot L2 or set /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches as
          below:

            $ sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
